# Neopixel-4x4x4-Cube-WS2811
Neopixel RGB 4x4x4 Cube using WEMOS D1 ESP8266

This project uses a WEMOS D1 Mini ESP8266 and WS2811 LED's in a progressive format
matrix.
Software and STL 3D print case is available.

This project was an attempt to construct and replace the Rainbowduino cube design.

The crude software will display various cube patterns.  I have modified code ideas
from the unavailable Rainbowduino platform.  The program requires the Adafruit_NeoMatrix 
library.  Optionally an encoder library, ErriezRotaryHalfStep.h was used for 
user selection and game deveolpment.

Again, novice programmer.
